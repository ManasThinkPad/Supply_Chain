Supply Chain Optimisation Using Deep Learning: This project leverages deep learning to enhance supply chain demand forecasting and inventory management. Using a Bidirectional LSTM model, it predicts future order quantities based on key supply chain parameters, helping businesses optimize logistics and reduce inefficiencies. 

Supply Chain Optimization Using Deep Learning 

Overview

This project leverages deep learning to enhance supply chain demand forecasting and inventory management. Using a Bidirectional LSTM model, it predicts future order quantities based on key supply chain parameters, helping businesses optimize logistics and reduce inefficiencies.  

Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes supply chain data, removes outliers, and handles missing values.  
- Deep Learning Model: Implements a Bidirectional LSTM for accurate demand forecasting.  
- Performance Metrics: Evaluates model efficiency using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.  
- Visualization: Includes line plots, scatter plots, and residual analysis to compare actual vs. predicted demand.  
- Results Storage: Saves performance metrics in a JSON file for further analysis.  

Technologies Used 
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM)
- Scikit-learn (StandardScaler, train-test split, performance metrics)

Objective 
The goal is to increase forecast accuracy, optimize inventory levels, and improve supply chain decision-making using AI-driven insights.
